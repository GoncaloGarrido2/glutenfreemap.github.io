# Contacts

We try to ensure that the information presented on GlutenFreeMap is as correct and complete as possible. If you find an error, want to suggest a missing location or for any other matter related to this application, you can contact us and we will try to integrate your suggestions.

The recommended way to contact us is through the GitHub platform. You will need to create an account in order to communicate with us. This is necessary because it allows us to manage the contacts we receive more efficiently.

There are several contact forms, according to the type of contact:

- [**Report application errors**](https://github.com/glutenfreemap/glutenfreemap.github.io/issues/new?template=en_bug_report.yml){:id="report-error" target=" _blank"}
   Use this option for any problem you find in the application, from errors during use to inaccuracies in the displayed information.

- [**Suggest a missing venue**](https://github.com/glutenfreemap/glutenfreemap.github.io/issues/new?template=en_suggest_venue.yml){:target="_blank"}
   Use this option to suggest an establishment that you think should be included in this application.

- [**Other topics**](https://github.com/glutenfreemap/glutenfreemap.github.io/discussions/new?category=general){:target="_blank"}
   Use this option for suggestions, comments or other matters.

## Alternative contact

If you cannot use the GitHub platform, you can also send an email to [glutenfreemap@aaubry.net](mailto:glutenfreemap@aaubry.net). However, we will give lower priority to requests received in this way.
